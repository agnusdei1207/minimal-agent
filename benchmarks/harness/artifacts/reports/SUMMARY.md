## Overview

- Model: `glm-5.3-flash` (glm-5.3-flash)
- Attempted: **13**
- Retained finalized attempts (including retries): **19**
- Score selection: newest finalized attempt per task. Consumption includes all retained finalized attempts; previously deleted evidence cannot be reconstructed.
- Scored: **13**
- SOLVED: **10** (76.9% of scored)
- Recorded attempt elapsed time: **3h 53m 10s** (13990s) — includes setup; teardown inclusion varies by harness
- Recorded durations are summed across retained attempts, including concurrent attempts; they are not campaign wall time or solver-only latency.

## Token totals — all attempts (solved + failed = total consumption)

| Bucket | Tokens |
|--------|-------:|
| Input (prompt) | 8.05M |
| Output (completion) | 304.6k |
| **Total (in + out)** | **8.35M** |

## Averages

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| Input / task | 619.0k |
| Output / task | 23.4k |
| Total tokens / task (in + out) | 642.5k |
| **Tokens / turn (in + out)** | - |
| Turns / task | - |
| Duration / task | 1076s |

## Cost

> Complete cost is unavailable: a unit price or an attempt measurement is missing.
> Aggregate cost renders `-`; raw per-attempt measurements remain in kpi.json.
